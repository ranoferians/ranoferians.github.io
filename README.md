# The Holy Ancient Civilization of the Ranoferians

## Welcome to the Ranoferians! This is the first modern ancient civilization in the world. Here is all the informaton you need to know about the Ranoferians.

## Introduction

### 	Our civilization is named The Ranoferians. Our geographic location is in Egypt (hence the name) and the time period is 500 BCE. Our population is about 7,500 and it has very fertile soil, good climate - the weather will be very sunny and hot because the location is in Egypt., and bodies of water for trading, fishing, and protection. The geography of Egypt protects us from invaders of all types from all countries. These features include the Red Sea and Nile Delta. There are also harsh desserts that are tough to cross. All these features of Egypt help us make a thriving civilization.

## Food Supply

### 	Our civilization has a variety of crops being grown to survive. There are a lot of different crops to grow in our society such as wheat, lettuce, pomegranates, corn, barley and other vegetables and grain. These are all very necessary for  our civilization to thrive and prosper.

### 	One of the crops being grown is wheat. Wheat is grown from our seeds and does not require a lot of water because it is  grown in the cooler seasons. Wheat can be made into bread and flour as well as other things. Wheat is our most abundant crop, it will cost two coppers per bread loaf. Wheat itself also costs two coppers per half a pound. Another one of our crops being grown is lettuce. Lettuce is a great crop to grow because it has a lot of nutrients and we can make meals out of it such as salads. Lettuce will be grown from our seeds.  Our lettuce will cost 3 coppers per half a pound. One of our fruits is pomegranates. Our pomegranates are very rare so they cost 5 coppers per half pound. They are grown on small trees and shrubs near our village. One of the crops that are very abundant is corn. Corn does not need a lot of water so it grows very fast. Corn is grown on stalks from our seeds.  The corn costs 1 copper per half a pound. The last grain that we are producing is barley. Barley is a type of grass grown from seeds and does not need a lot of water because it is grown in the cooler seasons. Our barley costs 1 copper per half a  pound. In our civilization, everyone loves beans so we are growing Pinto Beans. Pinto beans are grown from vines planted with our seeds. The beans don’t require a lot of water either so they are easy to care for. Pinto beans cost 2 coppers per half a pound. One of our other vegetables grown is tomatoes. Tomatoes take a while to grow so they aren’t very abundant. The tomatoes are planted with our seeds and then grown on vines.  Our tomatoes cost 4 coppers per half a pound. The last vegetable we grow is broccoli. Broccoli is abundant and it costs 3 coppers per half a pound. Figs are very popular in our economy but they take up to 4 months to grow, so they are rare. The figs are grown from our trees. Our figs cost 7 coppers per 1 ounce. 
	
### 	Our economy needs animals that are necessary for survival. Some of the animals our economy has are buffalos, camels, and fish. The buffalo are used for its meat for food, its fur for clothing, and for milk and cheese. The camel is used for riding across the desert and its fur for clothes. The fish are used for food. Another animal we are raising are the Egyptians Fayoumis (chickens). The Egyptian Fayoumis are used for their meat. They are native to our civilization because they are uncommon in the wild. We also need the chickens for their eggs and feathers. 

### 	In conclusion, all of these crops and animals are important and necessary for our economy to survive and thrive.

## Jobs

### Everyone has a job in our civilization to keep the economy growing. These jobs are merchants, enforcers, craftsmen, architects, farmers, scribes, construction workers, and priests. There are different salaries for each job as well. Each of these roles is crucial for our civilization to thrive. 

### The first job are merchants. Merchants sell and trade items made by craftsmen, items they got, and others. They also spread the latest news and gossip with the rest of the citizens. Of course, our civilization needs enforcers and a military or army. They are like the police we have today, they are responsible for making sure everything is going well within the civilization and that everyone is safe. They also have to protect and make sure no one attacks or tries to invade the area. Finally, they fight battles for their civilization. The next job our civilization will need is craftsmen. Craftsmen craft many things, hence their name. They make sculptures, weapons, tools, and everyday items that people use. Now onto architects. They are responsible for designing buildings and the many structures of our civilization. And of course, we need construction workers to build the buildings designed by the architects. Another important job is farming. Farmers have to produce food for citizens in our civilization, so no one has to starve. We also need scribes to copy documents and write historical records for important people such as kings, queens, and other people who helped our community. They serve as our record-keepers and are one of the few citizens who can read and write exceptionally. Finally, we need priests, or religious leaders, to teach about our religion to our citizens. This is very important as we take religion very seriously in our civilization.

### Now, let’s review the jobs’ salaries. Merchants’ salaries vary because they choose their prices for the items they sell. Craftsmen and architects both receive 12 coppers a week. Construction workers and scribes receive 15 coppers. Farmers receive 17 coppers a week for their food. Priests receive 20 coppers a week, and finally, enforcers and militaries get 25-30 coppers a week, and a bonus after fighting in battles. Raises and bonuses can be given to workers as well. Our coppers can be told apart by how many sides it has. For example, if copper has five sides, then it is worth five coppers. Two sides are worth two coppers. A circle, or no sides at all, will be worth one copper. The maximum sides a copper could have are ten sides, which is worth ten coppers.

### In our civilization, everyone is born with their parent's job and assists their parents with that job until they are 18 years of age. After they become adults, they are permitted to choose whether or not they want to continue working with their parents’ jobs, or change jobs. Even after they start their job, they are allowed to change jobs once in a while. Of course, this does not mean they can choose whatever job they want. It depends on their skill in that position and the well they act and serve their civilization. Workers could also lose their job if they aren’t using their skills for the good of the civilization. However, they can also move up into a position of more authority if they show dedication and great skill.

### In conclusion, the jobs of our civilization are necessary for our civilization to thrive and prosper. Each job has its place in society and is all needed for many different purposes.
