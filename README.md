# The Holy Ancient Civilization of the Ranoferians

## Welcome to the Ranoferians! This is the first modern ancient civilization in the world. Here is all the informaton you need to know about the Ranoferians.

## Introduction

### Our civilization is named The Ranoferians. Our geographic location is in Egypt (hence the name) and the time period is ### 500 BCE. Our population is about 7,500 and it has very fertile soil, good climate - the weather will be very sunny and ### hot because the location is in Egypt., and bodies of water for trading, fishing, and protection. The geography of Egypt ### protects us from invaders of all types from all countries. These features include the Red Sea and Nile Delta. There are ### also harsh desserts that are tough to cross. All these features of Egypt help us make a thriving civilization.

### Our civilization has a variety of crops being grown to survive. There are a lot of different crops to grow in our society such as wheat, lettuce, pomegranates, corn, barley and other vegetables and grain. These are all very necessary for  our civilization to thrive and prosper.

One of the crops being grown is wheat. Wheat is grown from our seeds and does not require a lot of water because it is grown in the cooler seasons. Wheat can be made into bread and flour as well as other things. Wheat is our most abundant crop, it will cost two coppers per bread loaf. Wheat itself also costs two coppers per half a pound. Another one of our crops being grown is lettuce. Lettuce is a great crop to grow because it has a lot of nutrients and we can make meals out of it such as salads. Lettuce will be grown from our seeds.  Our lettuce will cost 3 coppers per half a pound. One of our fruits is pomegranates. Our pomegranates are very rare so they cost 5 coppers per half pound. They are grown on small trees and shrubs near our village. One of the crops that are very abundant is corn. Corn does not need a lot of water so it grows very fast. Corn is grown on stalks from our seeds.  The corn costs 1 copper per half a pound. The last grain that we are producing is barley. Barley is a type of grass grown from seeds and does not need a lot of water because it is grown in the cooler seasons. Our barley costs 1 copper per half a  pound. In our civilization, everyone loves beans so we are growing Pinto Beans. Pinto beans are grown from vines planted with our seeds. The beans don’t require a lot of water either so they are easy to care for. Pinto beans cost 2 coppers per half a pound. One of our other vegetables grown is tomatoes. Tomatoes take a while to grow so they aren’t very abundant. The tomatoes are planted with our seeds and then grown on vines.  Our tomatoes cost 4 coppers per half a pound. The last vegetable we grow is broccoli. Broccoli is abundant and it costs 3 coppers per half a pound. Figs are very popular in our economy but they take up to 4 months to grow, so they are rare. The figs are grown from our trees. Our figs cost 7 coppers per 1 ounce. 
	
	Our economy needs animals that are necessary for survival. Some of the animals our economy has are buffalos, camels, and fish. The buffalo are used for its meat for food, its fur for clothing, and for milk and cheese. The camel is used for riding across the desert and its fur for clothes. The fish are used for food. Another animal we are raising are the Egyptians Fayoumis (chickens). The Egyptian Fayoumis are used for their meat. They are native to our civilization because they are uncommon in the wild. We also need the chickens for their eggs and feathers. 

In conclusion, all of these crops and animals are important and necessary for our economy to survive and thrive.
